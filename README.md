# Calling

A website I'm working on that will allow you to video call 
someone online.

## How

#### Dependencies: webcam-capture:0.3.2 ; slf4j-jdk14:1.7.36

1. In terminal, type ```git clone https://github.com/elijaheaton/Calling.git ```
2. Open in IntelliJ and add dependencies
3. Run Server.java

## Why

I want to delve into server work and revisit my knowledge of 
Java as I interview for my first Software Development job.
